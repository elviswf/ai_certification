# AI certification
 [中文版](README_cn.md)

AI certification is a special point to view the booming research and applications of AI, especially deep learning.

Considering the wide and rapidly increasing use of AI among all kinds of industry, a professional inspection and certification from 
third-party organizations becomes important for both customers and the whole society.  

Data plays an unprecedented role in deep learning. It also unavoidably involve public issues, such as **privacy**, **ethics**, 
**risk** and **safety**.

## Certificate for Neural network 

### Overview
It seems that IBM has focused on this area.
